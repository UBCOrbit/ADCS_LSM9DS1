\subsection*{Note}

This project is configured to use mutexes/ semaphores. Your version of H\+A\+L\+Co\+Gen might have a bug with generating Free\+R\+T\+OS code that enables mutexes.

This bug is documented \href{http://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/hercules/f/312/p/626490/2320355}{\tt here}.

The workaround is to copy the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{mpu__wrappers_8c_source}{mpu\+\_\+wrappers.\+c}}} file in {\ttfamily H\+A\+L\+Co\+Gen\+\_\+fix} to {\ttfamily $<$Your H\+A\+L\+Co\+Gen Install$>$/drivers/\+Free\+R\+T\+O\+S/portable/\+C\+C\+S/\+Coretex-\/\+R4/}. You may want to rename the original file to something like {\ttfamily mpu\+\_\+wrappers.\+c.\+old} just in case you want to restore it.
